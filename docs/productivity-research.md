# Productivity Techniques: Task Batching & Pomodoro

## Task Batching

### 🔄 Context Switching Costs

Switching between tasks causes **mental fatigue** and **time loss**. Studies show it takes **15–30 minutes** to refocus. Effects:

- 📉 Reduced productivity
- 😣 Increased stress
- ⚠️ Higher error risk

### ✅ Benefits of Grouping Similar Tasks

Batching reduces switching, maintains flow, and boosts efficiency. For example, check emails only twice daily.

**Key Benefits:**

- 🔍 Improved focus
- ⏱️ Better time use
- 📋 Streamlined workflow
- 🧠 Lower cognitive load

### 📌 Batching Strategies

1. **Thematic Days**: Assign tasks by day (e.g., Admin Mondays).
2. **Time Blocking**: Reserve time for task types (e.g., meetings AM, deep work PM).
3. **Batch Processing**: Group repetitive tasks (e.g., all emails at once).
4. **Tool Batching**: Do tasks requiring the same tools together.
5. **Priority Batching**: Group tasks by urgency/importance.

## Pomodoro Technique

### ⏳ Core Principles

- 25 min focused work (1 Pomodoro)
- 5 min break

**Why it works:**

- ⏰ Increases urgency
- 🎯 Sustains focus

### 🧩 Adapting to Task Types

**1. Deep Work (e.g., coding)**

- Use strict Pomodoros or extend to 45–50 min during flow

**2. Admin Tasks**

- Shorter Pomodoros (20 min) + frequent breaks

**3. Creative Work**

- Allow flexible timing; use breaks to recharge creativity

**4. Meetings/Calls**

- Fit into Pomodoro slots or group together

### 📱 Useful Apps

- **Focus To-Do**
